 * unit test ? I would like to use jasmine and upload tess to another suitelet that generate a report that i can easily curl and parse. npm test should do this. could we put some credentials in travis an do CI on git push?
 * make a bundle: be possible to bundle many files into one? is this correct in ss2 ?
